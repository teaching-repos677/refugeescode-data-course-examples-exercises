   "source": "# I. Jupyter Notebook Introduction \n\nWhile the fastest way to start writing commands in the Python programming language is through your **terminal** (*an interface for interacting directly with your computer*), the terminal...is not exactly \"user friendly\": editing anything you've written requires navigating with your keyboard arrows character by character, and running different programs at the same time requires opening a new shell. Good luck keeping track of all the floating windows! 😅\n\n<img src=\"../../assets/screenshot_shells.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of shells\" width=\"400\"/>\n🫣\n\nMoving forward, we'll be using Jupyter Notebook to interact with our computers through Python. Jupyter Notebook is a web-based Interactive Development Environemnt (IDE)-- this means you can write, run, and organize code in a notebook form, all from your browser rather than a terminal shell. \n\n🪄 And this -- this document that you are reading right now -- is a Jupyter Notebook. ✨"
